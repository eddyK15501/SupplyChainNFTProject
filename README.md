ItemManager.sol and Item.sol is a contract mimicking a supply chain using blockchain.

You start by creating an item, paying for it, then delivering that item. This is a contract written as a sample code on an Udemy course that I completed. The course is called: Ethereum Blockchain Developer Bootcamp With Solidity.

I created an ERC721 contract called ItemNFT.sol to add to this project. Whenever you create a new item, a new instance of an Item.sol contract gets created, along with an NFT token to resemble that item.

Test code written using ethers.js.
